# Installation

## Wally

Get the latest version of Pack from [wally.run](https://wally.run/package/isoopod/pack) and add it to your wally.toml

For best results, you will need to run [wally-package-types](https://crates.io/crates/wally-package-types) for the needed internal types to be exported.  
Without doing this, you will not have access to the Pack.Schema type needed to use tuple schemas.

## Manual

Download the latest version of Pack from [releases](https://github.com/isoopod/Pack/releases) and insert it somewhere in ReplicatedStorage.
